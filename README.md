# LoginSystem_PHP
This repository contains my PHP practice code where I have tried to create Login System using PHP and MYSQL<br>
I have tried to use Design Pattern while coding for this project.<br>
Basically I have segregated my code into different files.<br>
For eg: DBconnect.php contains only my Database Connection.<br>
login.php contains only login code.<br>
This way I have tried to keep my code separeate which can be easy and handy to use.<br>
Just you have to use this line of code include("filename.php");<br>
